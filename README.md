# SystemDocker Common
Common drop-ins and utilities for SystemDocker units

## Drop-ins
All drop-ins are stored in the `dropins/` folder. Where the filename ends `.conf` these drop-ins are designed to be symbolically linked to from the drop-in directory of your service (see [Using drop-ins](#using-drop-ins)); where they end `.conf.tpl` these drop-ins are designed to be used as a template and should be copied into the drop-in directory of your service and edited there (see [Using drop-in templates](#using-drop-in-templates)).
